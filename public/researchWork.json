        "brief":"People are currently living in a world with a variety of options to choose from. Now people are forced to choose between careers, places to live, holiday destinations, and a number of other consumer products. While traditional economic models assume that large choice sets are beneficial for consumers, research from behavioral economics has found that consumers frequently avoid making choices in high choice set environments. In this paper, I review choice overload and choice aversion to understand why consumers get overwhelmed when presented with too many choices.",
